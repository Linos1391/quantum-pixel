# Introduction

I made this in response of AI slop. Those so-called AI artists had gone too far that annoy me... I am not against the development of AI, but the disrespects towards ARTS and ARTISTS.

**Notice:** it is still in development and not guaranteed protected from img2img. I tried on Grok some details are detected, most are NOT :D.

- Local system: WIP

# Can I host from [Github](https://github.com/Linos1391/quantum-pixel)?

- For private use or sharing with friends? Absolutely yes. I am using the free version of Render right now and totally recommend to try.

- For your website? You may embed this project as it is and let it be entirely free.

Remember, this will NOT 100% prevent AI from analyzing; in fact, the process of Steganography is open-source. I am still researching for better algorithms and would love to hear from YOU!
